# MNIST Digit Recognition

A beginner-friendly machine learning project for handwritten digit recognition using neural networks.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Source code for the model and training
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and visualization
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Dataset
Using the MNIST dataset (70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits).

## Goals
1. Build and train a neural network
2. Achieve >95% accuracy
3. Visualize results
4. Follow Git best practices with incremental commits

## Development
We'll use `develop` branch for development and `main` for stable versions.

## Current Status
- [x] Project setup
- [x] Dependencies installed
- [ ] Dataset loaded
- [ ] Model defined
- [ ] Training completed
- [ ] Evaluation done
